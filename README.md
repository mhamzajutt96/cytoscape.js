### How to run this project
- Clone the project using this command git clone https://github.com/mhamzajutt96/cytoscape.js.git
- After cloning, you need to setup the http-server on your local machine.
- Once that is done, just move to the directory of the project and type **http-server ./** It will fire up the server.
- There are two links there, one for the dagre graph and other one for the cytoscape.
- Afterwards you can explore on your own.
